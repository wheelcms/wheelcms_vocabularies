WheelCMS Vocabularies
=====================

WheelCMS Vocabularies offers "through the web" managable collections
of hierarchical vocabularies that can be referenced in content (models)
by id.

Vocabularies are hierarchical collections of (id, label) items with additional
tags and description.

Tags can be used to define additional behaviour/properties of a vocabulary
term, for example if it's selectable, or something application specific.

Initially, the vocabularies are simple JSON structures that can be managed in
a textare. At a later stage, something like http://dbushell.github.io/Nestable/
may be integrated.
